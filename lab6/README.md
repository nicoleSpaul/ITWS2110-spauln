I didn't really run into too much trouble working on this lab, though it did make me search up whether or not 
PHP was a language with first class functions (it is!!) which is something I just learned about in programming languages. This is what makes PHPs callbacks possible that we learned in ITWS 1100. I answered all the questions on the lab6.php file, just wanted to detail that here because I wasn't sure which file I should answer them in.

For reference I used the PHP slide decks and this page on Get /Post requests:
