I spent a lot of time on this lab!! all the graphics besides the emojis were made by me using Procreate, and I wanted to give it a cute-sy, playful feel unlike most weather apps that display information in a more clinical way. I initially had quite a bit of trouble understanding how to use the api key correctly, but referring to the open weather documentation was really helpful!! Besides that, I used the lecture slides as well as w3schools website into using the different layouts flex and inline-block, and I thought this was a really fun lab! I chose to use data from NASA's NEO close approach API, since on October 9th there were some pretty cool events so I was wondering what more might happen throughthe rest of this year.
